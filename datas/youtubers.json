Born and raised in Gothenburg, Sweden, Kjellberg registered his YouTube channel 'PewDiePie' in 2010, primarily posting Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. Kjellberg's channel became the most-subscribed on YouTube on 15 August 2013, but after he publicly vied for the title with T-Series in 2019, it currently holds the title of the second-most subscribed, albeit remaining the most-subscribed operated by an individual.",
